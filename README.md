# Dino-Game-128x64-OLED-using-FPGA
Welcome to Dino Kitty Jump, a retro-style side-scroller game implemented in Verilog HDL. This adorable cat isn’t just cute—it jumps, dodges obstacles, and flashes with flair when hit!  Designed for FPGA boards with basic ouput support, this project is a demonstration of sprite rendering, animation, collision detection, and game logic in hardware.
